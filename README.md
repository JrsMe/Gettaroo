## Update project for version 1.21.1
Hello, I would like this project to be resumed.
I would like you to help me update this Minecraft mod for Minecraft version 1.21.1
This mod was originally created by d4nnn, this mod was abandoned since version 1.17.1 and given my little experience in creating mods for Minecraft
I require the help of anyone who wants to help get this mod back on track.
Thanks for your attention, sorry for the inconvenience.
